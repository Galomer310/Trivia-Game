Gal, hello.

Your server-side and frontend code looks well-organized, and you're following best practices like using a connection pool and managing API errors.

Also, I should mention that your README is awesome â€” a nicely wrapped project!

There are a few minor issues we could fix, but overall, I believe you're ready for something more complicated and challenging.

We can achieve that with this project. What I recommend is taking this project and building an automated installer for it.

By that, I mean creating a command-line tool that will install the game, set up all dependencies, install the database, and configure everything needed. I think it will be an interesting challenge for you!
